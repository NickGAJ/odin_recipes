    <h1>Pulp Fiction Burger</h1>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <h3> <ul> 
<li>1 pound ground beef (85 percent lean), preferably grass-fed </li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
<li>Mayonnaise, for grilling buns and for serving </li>
<li>4 seeded hamburger buns, such as Big Marty's </li>
<li>4 slices American cheese </li>
<li>1 beefsteak tomato, sliced into 1/4-inch-thick rounds </li>

</h3>
<br> 
<h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
<h3><ol>
<li>Preheat grill for direct-heat cooking. Gently form beef into 4 patties, each 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2 inch thick (do not overwork meat or patties will be tough). Season generously with salt and pepper. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto the cut sides of each bun.</li>
<br>
<li>Place patties on grill and cook, uncovered, until browned and sizzling on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip, top each with a slice of cheese, cover grill, and cook until cheese is melted and patties are medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a plate. Place buns on grill cut-side down; cook just until lightly toasted and golden brown in places, about 1 minute.</li>
<br>
<li>Dress the cut side of each bottom bun with ketchup and mayonnaise (or desired condiments), then top with patties. Place a tomato slice on top of each patty and season with salt. Stack with pickles and lettuce. Dress cut side of top buns with condiments, then sandwich toppings and serve.</li>
